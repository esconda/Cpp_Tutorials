// In the example below, if memory_mapped_port were not volatile, the compiler could optimize the function so that it
// performs only the final write, which would be incorrect if sizeof(int) is greater than 1. The volatile qualification
// forces it to treat all sizeof(int) writes as different side effects and hence perform all of them (in order)

also signed. signed char has a range that includes at least -127 to +127, inclusive.
*When combined with short, long, or long long, it is redundant, since those types are already signed.
*signed cannot be combined with bool, wchar_t, char16_t, or char32_t */
