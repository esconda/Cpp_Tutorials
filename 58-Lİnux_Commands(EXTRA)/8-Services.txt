Systemd service management

Listing services
* systemctl -> To list running services
* systemctl --failed -> To list failed services

* systemctl get-default -> To find the default target for your system
* systemctl set-default <target-name> -> To set the default target for your system

Managing services at runtime
* systemctl start [service-name] -> To start a service
* systemctl stop [service-name] -> To stop a service
* systemctl restart [service-name] -> To restart a service
* systemctl reload [service-name] -> To request service to reload its configuration
* systemctl status [service-name] -> To show current status of a service

Managing autostart of services
* systemctl is-enabled [service-name] -> To show whether a service is enabled on system boot
* systemctl is-active [service-name] -> To show whether a service is currently active(running)
* systemctl enable [service-name] -> To enable a service on system boot
* systemctl disable [service-name] -> To disable a service on system boot

Masking services
* systemctl mask [service-name] -> To mask a service (Makes it hard to start a service by mistake)
* systemctl unmask [service-name] -> To unmask a service

Restarting systemd
* systemctl daemon-reload
