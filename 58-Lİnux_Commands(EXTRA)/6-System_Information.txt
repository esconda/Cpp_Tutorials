Statistics about CPU, Memory, Network and Disk (I/O operations)
* mpstat 2 10 -> To get processors related statistics you can use mpstat command but with some options it will provide better visibility
* vmstat 2 10 -> RAM but to see all statistic including I/O operations
* iostat -kx 2 -> information about your disk operations in real time you can utilise iostat
* lscpu -> 


Network
* netstat -ntlp -> open TCP sockets
* netstat -nulp -> open UDP sockets
* netstat -nxlp -> open Unix sockets
* sudo iftop -> you can find useful monitoring to see network traffic in real time


lscpu
lshw | grep cpu

List Hardware
lshw is a small tool to extract detailed information on the hardware configuration of the machine. 
* sudo lshw | less (or more)
* sudo lshw -html > myhardware.html
* sudo lshw -xml > myhardware.xml
* lspci -tv -> To show PCI info
* lsusb -tv -> To see USB info
* dmidecode -q | less -> To display BIOS information
* hdparm -i /dev/sda -> To see specific information about disk (disk sda in example) you can use
* smartctl -A /dev/sda | grep Power_On_Hours -> How long has this disk (system) been powered on in total
* hdparm -tT /dev/sda -> Do a read speed test on disk sda
* badblocks -s /dev/sda -> Test for unreadable blocks on disk sda

Find CPU model/speed information
cat /proc/cpuinfo
grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo

Process monitoring and information gathering
* ps -e -o pid,args --forest -> List processes in a hierarchy
* ps -e -o pcpu,cpu,nice,state,cputime,args --sort pcpu | sed '/^ 0.0 /d' -> List processes sorted by % cpu usage
* ps -e -orss=,args= | sort -b -k1,1n | pr -TW$COLUMNS -> List processes sorted by mem (KB) usage.
* ps -C firefox-bin -L -o pid,tid,pcpu,state -> List all threads for a particular process
* lsof ~ -> Or based on path find out list processes that have specified path open
* top -> Most commonly known tool for dynamic monitoring
* htop -d 5 -> Still there are more advance options that can be considered and installed as top replacement
* atop
* sudo iotop
