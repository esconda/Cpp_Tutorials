Sometimes it may be required to find out which directory consuming how much disk space especially when you are
* used df -h and realized your available disk space is low

Investigate Directories For Disk Usage
* du -> du command summarizes disk usage of the set of FILEs, recursively for directories
* du -sh * -> For summarizing disk usages of the files in the current directory we use
* du -sh .[!.]* * -> We can also include hidden files with using
* du -sch .[!.]* * -> Thirdly, you can add total to the output by adding ,-c, option
* sudo du -sch /.[!.]* /* -> Investigate root directory for disk usage
* sudo du --threshold=1G -ch /.[!.]* /* -> Lastly, the best method forms when you add a threshold size value for directories to ignore small ones. 

Checking Disk Space
* df -h ->It's quite common to want to check the status of the various partitions/drives on your server/computer to see how full they are
