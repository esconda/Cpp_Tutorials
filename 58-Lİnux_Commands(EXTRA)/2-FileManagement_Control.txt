Directory navigation
* pwd -> Get the full path of the current working directory.
* cd - -> Navigate to the last directory you were working in.
* cd ~ or -> just cd Navigate to the current user's home directory.
* cd .. -> Go to the parent directory of current directory (mind the space between cd and ..)

Listing files inside a directory
* ls -l -> List the files and directories in the current directory in long (table) format (It is recommended to
* use -l -> with ls for better readability).
* ls -ld dir-name -> List information about the directory dir-name instead of its contents.
* ls -a -> List all the files including the hidden ones (File names starting with a . are hidden files in Linux).
* ls -F -> Appends a symbol at the end of a file name to indicate its type (* means executable, / means directory, @ means symbolic link, = means socket, | means named pipe, > means door).
* ls -lt -> List the files sorted by last modified time with most recently modified files showing at the top (remember -l option provides the long format which has better readability).
* ls -lh -> List the file sizes in human readable format.
* ls -lR -> Shows all subdirectories recursively.
* tree -> Will generate a tree representation of the file system starting from the current directory.
* ls -a -> list all files including hidden file starting with '.'
* ls --color -> colored list [=always/never/auto]
* ls -d -> list directories - with ' */'
* ls -F -> add one char of */=>@| to enteries
* ls -i -> list file's inode index number
* ls -l -> list with long format - show permissions
* ls -la -> list long format including hidden files
* ls -lh -> list long format with readable file size
* ls -ls -> list with long format with file size
* ls -r -> list in reverse order
* ls -R -> list recursively directory tree
* ls -s -> list file size
* ls -S -> sort by file size
* ls -t -> sort by time & date
* ls -X -> sort by extension name

File/directory create, copy and remove
* cp -p source destination -> Will copy the file from source to destination. -p stands for preservation. It preserves the original attributes of file while copying like file owner, timestamp, group, permissions etc.
* cp -R source_dir destination_dir -> Will copy source directory to specified destination recursively.
* mv file1 file2 -> In Linux there is no rename command as such. Hence mv moves/renames the file1 to file2.
* rm -i filename -> Asks you before every file removal for confirmation. IF YOU ARE A NEW USER TO LINUX COMMAND LINE, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS USE rm -i. You can specify multiple files.
* rm -R dir-name -> Will remove the directory dir-name recursively.
* rm -rf dir-name -> Will remove the directory dir recursively, ignoring non-existent files and will never prompt for anything. BE CAREFUL USING THIS COMMAND! You can specify multiple directories.
* rmdir dir-name -> Will remove the directory dir-name, if it's empty. This command can only remove empty directories.
* mkdir dir-name -> Create a directory dir-name.
* mkdir -p dir-name/dir-name -> Create a directory hierarchy. Create parent directories as needed, if they don't exist. You can specify multiple directories.
* touch filename -> Create a file filename, if it doesn't exist, otherwise change the timestamp of the file to current time.

File/directory permissions and groups
* chmod <specification> filename -> Change the file permissions. Specifications = u user, g group, o other, + add permission, - remove, r read, w write,x execute.
* chmod -R <specification> dirname -> Change the permissions of a directory recursively. To change permission of a directory and everything within that directory, use this command.
* chmod go=+r myfile -> Add read permission for the owner and the group.
* chmod a +rwx myfile -> Allow all users to read, write or execute myfile.
* chmod go -r myfile -> Remove read permission from the group and others.
* chown owner1 filename -> Change ownership of a file to user owner1.
* chgrp grp_owner filename -> Change primary group ownership of file filename to group grp_owner.
* chgrp -R grp_owner dir-name -> Change primary group ownership of directory dir-name to group grp_owner recursively. To change group ownership of a directory and everything within that directory, use this command
