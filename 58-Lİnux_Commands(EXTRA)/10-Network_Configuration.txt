This document covers TCP/IP networking, network administration and system configuration basics. Linux can
support multiple network devices. The device names are numbered and begin at zero and count upwards. For
example, a computer with two NICs will have two devices labeled eth0 and eth1.

1)Local DNS resolution
* /etc/hosts -> contains a list of hosts that are to be resolved locally(not by DNS)

2)Configure DNS servers for domain name resolution
*  /etc/resolv.conf -> contains a list of DNS servers for domain name resolution
* dig google.com @your.dns.server.com +short -> In case internal DNS server you can validate if this server resolve DNS names properly using dig command

3)See and manipulate routes
* route -> Displays list or routes and also resolves host names
* route -n -> Displays list of routes without resolving host names for faster results

Add/Delete route
* add or del -> Add or delete a route
* -host x.x.x.x -> Add route to a single host identified by the IP address
* -net x.x.x.x -> Add route to a network identified by the network address
* gw x.x.x.x -> Specify the network gateway
* netmask x.x.x.x -> Specify the network netmask
* default -> Add a default route

Examples:
* add route to a host $ route add -host x.x.x.x eth1
* add route to a network $ route add -net 2.2.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth0
* Alternatively, you could also use cidr format to add a route to network route add -net 2.2.2.0/24 eth0
* add default gateway $ route add default gw 2.2.2.1 eth0
* delete a route $ route del -net 2.2.2.0/24

4)Configure a hostname for some other system on your network
* sudo cat 192.168.1.44 remote_pc
Then you can make that ping just by:
* ping remote_pc

5)Interface details
* ifconfig -a -> List all the interfaces available on the machine
* ifconfig eth0 -> List the details of a specific interface
* ethtool eth0 -> Ethtool - query the network driver and hardware settings
* ip { link | ... | route | macsec } -> ip - show / manipulate routing, devices, policy routing and tunnels
* ip link show -> List network interfaces
* ip link set dev eth0 name wan -> Rename interface eth0 to wan
* ip link set dev eth0 up -> Bring interface eth0 up (or down)
* ip addr show -> List addresses for interfaces
* ip addr add 1.2.3.4/24 brd + dev eth0 -> Add (or del) ip and mask (255.255.255.0)

6)Adding IP to an interface
An IP address to an interface could be obtained via DHCP or Static assignment
DHCP If you are connected to a network with a DHCP server running, dhclient command can get an IP address for
your interface
* dhclient <interface>
or alternatively, you could make a change to the /etc/network/interfaces file for the interface to be brought up
on boot and obtain DHCP IP
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

Static configuration(Permanent Change) using /etc/network/interfaces file.if you want to statically configure the interface settings(permanent change), you could do so in the
/etc/network/interfaces file.

* ifconfig <interface> <ip-address>/<mask> up -> A static IP address could be added to an interface using the ifconfig utility as follows
* ifconfig eth0 10.10.50.100/16 up
