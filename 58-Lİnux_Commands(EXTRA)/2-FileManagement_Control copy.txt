Directory navigation

pwd -> Get the full path of the current working directory.
cd - -> Navigate to the last directory you were working in.
cd ~ or -> just cd Navigate to the current user's home directory.
cd .. -> Go to the parent directory of current directory (mind the space between cd and ..)

Listing files inside a directory

ls -l -> List the files and directories in the current directory in long (table) format (It is recommended to
use -l -> with ls for better readability).
ls -ld dir-name -> List information about the directory dir-name instead of its contents.
ls -a -> List all the files including the hidden ones (File names starting with a . are hidden files in Linux).
ls -F -> Appends a symbol at the end of a file name to indicate its type (* means executable, / means directory, @ means symbolic link, = means socket, | means named pipe, > means door).
ls -lt -> List the files sorted by last modified time with most recently modified files showing at the top (remember -l option provides the long format which has better readability).
ls -lh -> List the file sizes in human readable format.
ls -lR -> Shows all subdirectories recursively.
tree -> Will generate a tree representation of the file system starting from the current directory.

File/directory create, copy and remove

cp -p source destination -> Will copy the file from source to destination. -p stands for preservation. It preserves the original attributes of file while copying like file owner, timestamp, group, permissions etc.
cp -R source_dir destination_dir -> Will copy source directory to specified destination recursively.
mv file1 file2 -> In Linux there is no rename command as such. Hence mv moves/renames the file1 to file2.
rm -i filename -> Asks you before every file removal for confirmation. IF YOU ARE A NEW USER TO LINUX COMMAND LINE, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS USE rm -i. You can specify multiple files.
rm -R dir-name -> Will remove the directory dir-name recursively.
rm -rf dir-name -> Will remove the directory dir recursively, ignoring non-existent files and will never prompt for anything. BE CAREFUL USING THIS COMMAND! You can specify multiple directories.
rmdir dir-name -> Will remove the directory dir-name, if it's empty. This command can only remove empty directories.
mkdir dir-name -> Create a directory dir-name.
mkdir -p dir-name/dir-name -> Create a directory hierarchy. Create parent directories as needed, if they don't exist. You can specify multiple directories.
touch filename Create a file filename, if it doesn't exist, otherwise change the timestamp of the
file to current time.

File/directory permissions and groups

chmod <specification> filename -> Change the file permissions. Specifications = u user, g group, o other, + add permission, - remove, r read, w write,x execute.
chmod -R <specification> dirname -> Change the permissions of a directory recursively. To change permission of a directory and everything within that directory, use this command.
chmod go=+r myfile -> Add read permission for the owner and the group.
chmod a +rwx myfile -> Allow all users to read, write or execute myfile.
chmod go -r myfile -> Remove read permission from the group and others.
chown owner1 filename -> Change ownership of a file to user owner1.
chgrp grp_owner filename -> Change primary group ownership of file filename to group grp_owner.
chgrp -R grp_owner dir-name -> Change primary group ownership of directory dir-name to group grp_owner recursively. To change group ownership of a directory and everything within that directory, use this command
